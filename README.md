## 🧠 Crash Detection & Auto-Restart

The bot will:
- Monitor each instance’s `dcs.log` for fatal errors (e.g., `Access violation`)
- Watch active processes for unexpected shutdowns
- Auto-restart any failed server
- Log all actions to `Logs/bot_actions.log`

## ⚙️ Auto-Start Task Scheduler Setup

A prebuilt XML file (`DCSAdminBot_Task.xml`) is included in the repo.

It is configured to:
- Launch `start_bot.bat` on user logon
- Run with elevated privileges
- Start both the PowerShell script (to start and sanitize all DCS instances) and the Python bot

To import it:
1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Choose "Import Task"
3. Select `DCSAdminBot_Task.xml`
4. Set it to run as your user with highest privileges
