# 📋 DCS Admin Bot — Quick Command Guide

Welcome! You can control the DCS servers from this channel using these simple commands:

---

## ▶️ Start a Server
```
!start southern
!start memphis
!start smokey
```

## 🛑 Stop a Server
```
!stop southern
```

## 🔁 Restart a Server or All
```
!restart memphis
!restart all
!restart windows  <-- Reboots the whole machine (admins only!)
```

## 📡 Check Server Status
```
!status
```

## 🧹 Clean Up Messages
```
!clear
```

## ❓ Help / Show Commands
```
!help
```

---

⚠️ Make sure you use this in the bot’s command channel — the bot only listens there.  
If a server crashes, the bot will automatically restart it and post a warning.
